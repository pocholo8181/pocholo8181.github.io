                    My friend asked me to do a HTML even though it is a simple one that I will make and he also said he will pay.
                    Of course I gladly accepted that and he was my first customer to do a commission to me. We talked about what they 
                    want in it the project. I added some login, sign up, shopping cart and check out.

                    This was the final output that I made for him. Some of the tabs were added later on as he requested. It was a fun project 
                    since it was paid and a little bit tiring since it was a bit rushed.

                    After a few days, he payed me via Paymaya load. It took a few days because of timings and his parents did not want him to go out.
