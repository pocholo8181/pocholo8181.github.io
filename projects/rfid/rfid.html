                    &nbsp; &nbsp; After I sent an email, the next day I got an email from sir Arn asking what time will be available.
                    He said he will ask some question and stuff. I told him that I am available at 3pm. He then told
                    me to join in a Zoom meeting and we talk about things like my knowledge about SQL and many more.
                    After the meeting, he told me to make a CRUD project in PHP and it needs to be passed the next day.
                    I was shocked but I did my best to do it as fast as possible. It was fun because I am getting a
                    hand of SQL a bit more. The next day he told me that I now need to pass the documents that we need
                    and we are forwarded to the company. I also sent an email with my CV and letter of application
                    to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 3 days, I got an email from the company and replied that they received
                    my email. Weeks later I got the "Practical Industry Partner" file and sent it to my OJT Adviser.
                    The head of the company made a group chat and discussed about the project they want us to do.
                    They told us we are going to make a RFID Attendance Monitoring System and the devices that we
                    will need.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; On this day, sir Arn which our OJT guide suggests that we should start practicing on a simple CRUD project
                    so that if we start on the main project, things will be easier for us. We made the UI simple since it is
                    not the main one yet and the functions are working well. It took us one week since we are still getting
                    a hang of C# with UI and we took breaks so that we won't get burnout on the project. Sir Arn said that
                    the project was good and we should start on the main project but we have to wait for the decision of
                    the company's boss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started the project after a few weeks since the company's boss is busy too and we also got busy in school.
                    But we managed to have a meeting and talk about the things for the project. Devices for the project was
                    discussed and the flow of it. They then talk about the devices like the scanner for the RFID and the
                    device that texts the student's parents if they tap it in. My partner and I got a bit intimidated
                    since we don't have experience in those but they said we can do it after we finish the UI and 
                    functions. After the meeting, my partner and I planned to make UI so that they have choices
                    for the UI. We then made the UI for a couple of days since it was a bit hard to make a good one
                    especially for me where I just do a simple UI and that is it. After we did our UI, we showed it
                    to the group chat and waited for their reply. Sir Arn suggested some ideas for the UI. 
                    The next day we showed our work yet again and my partner's UI was chosen. His work was good
                    and I agreed that it was better than mine. Sir Arn then told us that we can now start work
                    on the project.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; In this moment, we started working on the project. It was tough for a few days since we are
                    adding functions that is needed for the system and look for samples in the internet.
                    From this time, we just started working on the project as we can. We also took breaks
                    since there's some things that at first was hard of us. Some of the codes would not work
                    and we would get stuck for ours. Even though there is two of us working on in, it was tough
                    but it was fun since we are learning more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This took us like a month by doing small works
                    day by day as we can. A lot of of crying and brainless nights of work for it work well.
                    It was worth it because it was working and not much bugs were there. My partner and I
                    were happy and we told them in the group chat that it is ready for demo. They then told
                    told us we can do a demo tomorrow with the company's boss. My partner messaged me if
                    I am nervous, I giggled and told him that not much since we are finally about to be finish
                    and I am actually excited to be done. We both laughed and slept afterwards to prepare for
                    tomorrow. At last, the moment has come. We are now preparing for the demo and made a 
                    google meet room. We are now waiting for them to come. After a few minutes they finally
                    got in. We then show them our proud work to them and along the way, they ask some things
                    about the project. The presentation was smooth and we are finished. They told us that
                    the project was good and working. But of course, it needs more polishing. It was fine
                    since I knew it will need some polishing. They asked if we can still work on the devices
                    and we told them we can't since we do not have experience for it. They we're nice about it
                    and said that they will now process the certificates for our OJT. After that we thanked them
                    and told them about the things we need for our OJT. They then asked us that if they needed more
                    work on the system, we will be the one who will do it. We accepted it since we pretty much 
                    made the system. And we are done on the project for now.
