                    &nbsp; &nbsp; On this day, I sent an email and got a reply asking what time will I be available.
                    I told him 3pm and he agreed. He asked me to do simple PHP CRUD and will be sent the next day.
                    I finished it and gave it to him. He said it was good and we should wait for the company's email.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; While we are waiting for the company, he asked us to do a CRUD in C# this time.
                    Simple UI is okay since we are focused on the functionalities. It took us a week since we
                    are still figuring things out on it. After we finished the simple project, we showed it
                    to him and said that it was good. He then told us we are ready for the main project.
                </p>
                    <br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point, the company told us the system that he want to have and devices that
                    will be used in the system. We then started the project while waiting for the devices so that 
                    it have progress. The project took us weeks since there's some hard functionalities that is
                    needed in the project and we took breaks for us to not be burnout. We showed them the progress
                    of the project so that they are aware. After we finished the project, we showed the final
                    system to them. It was good but it needs some polishing. We didn't do the devices since
                    it was complicated for us to do and they said it was okay. It was a fun experience to
                    work with them.
