                    I received an email from someone asking for a commission for their project. I happily agreed to his project. He then
                    asked me to add him in discord.

                    We then talked about what he wants on his project. He explained what background, information and many more for his project.
                    I did what he asked me to do regarding to snakes informations. I thought to myself that this is an interesting topic. 
                    I enjoyed doing this project since it peaked my interest regarding to the topic. I gave some samples if he liked it, luckily he did.
                    I then sent the files and told him my rate on this project. I am happy that he accepted it. Took one day for the money to come but it was okay.

                    This is the final output of the project.
